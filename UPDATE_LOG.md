### Piggyback: rider no longer invisible + camera follows the carrier

Two long-standing piggyback bugs traced back to the same 2.1.1 fix attempt (the zero-volume `BoundingBox` + the `MountedComponent`); both are reversed here with the actual root cause addressed.

- **Rider invisibility (fixed).** Shrinking the rider's `BoundingBox` to a zero-volume box made `getMaximumThickness()` return `0`. The engine's `EntityTrackerSystems.LODCull` drops any entity where `maximumThickness < ENTITY_LOD_RATIO * distanceSq` — with thickness `0` that is true for every viewer not standing exactly on the rider, so the rider was removed from everyone's visible set and never rendered (no model/skin/mount packets sent). The box is no longer touched. (Players don't physically collide with each other in this engine — all entity-collision systems are NPC-only — so the box-shrink was guarding against a push that can't happen; the original "Jump in location" spam came from the follow-system teleport, and piggyback range is ≤5 blocks so no large jump occurs.)
- **Rider camera stationary (fixed).** The rider was given an engine `MountedComponent` with `MountController.Minecart` — the only entity-mount controller the engine has. That puts the rider's *own* client into "driver" mode: it simulates the mount's motion locally and anchors the camera to that local sim. Since a piggyback carrier is a real player who walks under their own power (the rider supplies no steering input), the rider's local sim never moved the "mount" and the camera froze. We no longer attach a `MountedComponent`. The rider is carried as an ordinary player whose position **and velocity** are slaved to the carrier every tick by `PiggybackFollowSystem`, which keeps the rider's normal player camera and makes it track the carrier smoothly.
- `PiggybackFollowSystem` now applies a small vertical seat offset (`RIDE_OFFSET_Y`, 1.0 blocks) so the rider sits on the carrier's back/shoulders instead of clipping inside them (the old client-side `MountedComponent` attachment offset is gone with the component).
- `PiggybackService` simplified: removed the `BoundingBox` snapshot/shrink/restore plumbing and the `MountedComponent` attach/remove; the engine-mount guards (refuse to start a piggyback while a participant is on a real minecart/seat) are retained.

> Note: the "rider is a passive passenger; the carrier walks normally" control model was chosen deliberately. The engine offers no native passenger-on-a-moving-entity mount mode, so the camera-follow is achieved via server-side position/velocity slaving rather than a client mount attachment.

## 2026-04-09 — 2.1.1 (continued)

### Marriage XP Even-Split (`XP Rework`)

- The marriage XP system has been reworked from a **one-way share** (spouse receives `xpShareMultiplier` of the earner's XP) to a **50/50 even split** (earner's adjusted XP is pooled and divided equally between both partners).
- When near spouse, the earner's post-bonus XP is halved: the earner keeps half, and the other half is granted to the spouse via `EndlessLevelingAPI.adjustRawXp` (no double-dipping on discipline/luck bonuses, no listener re-fire).
- **Party exclusivity:** marriage XP split and party XP sharing are now mutually exclusive. If the earner is in a party (`EndlessLevelingAPI.isInParty`), only the discipline/kiss bonuses apply — the even split is skipped entirely so party distribution is not doubled.
- Over time, both partners converge on the same total XP regardless of who killed what.
- Updated Javadoc in [`EndlessMarriage`](src/main/java/com/airijko/endlessleveling/endlessmarriage/EndlessMarriage.java) to reflect the new system.

## 2026-04-08 — 2.1.1 (compared to 2.1.0)

A focused bug-fix pass on top of 2.1.0. The headlines are a piggyback collision fix, a brand-new `PiggybackFollowSystem` so the rider's camera actually moves with the carrier, multi-world correctness for the proximity tick, and outright cancellation of spouse-on-spouse damage.

### Highlights

- Piggyback rider's `BoundingBox` is now shrunk to a zero-volume box during a session — fixes the carrier velocity reset / "Jump in location" warning spam.
- New **`PiggybackFollowSystem`** copies the carrier's position to the rider every tick, so the rider's camera no longer stays glued to the spot where they pressed the use key.
- `MarriageProximitySystem` rewritten to be **per-store**, fixing both a multi-world tick-rate bug and a `Store.assertThread()` violation on cross-world spouse lookups.
- `SpouseProtectionSystem` now **outright cancels** all spouse-on-spouse damage (melee + projectile), in addition to the existing piggyback damage reduction.
- New `MarriageConfigMigrator` schema bump (v1 → v2) — every user config gets merged forward on the next boot.
- `/marry admin menu` renamed to `/marry admin testmenu` to free up the `menu` slot.
- **Marriage XP even-split** — XP sharing reworked from a one-way share to a 50/50 split (party-exclusive).

### Piggyback Collision Fix (`Bug Fixes`)

- [`PiggybackService`](src/main/java/com/airijko/endlessleveling/endlessmarriage/services/PiggybackService.java) now snapshots the rider's `BoundingBox` into `riderBoundingBoxSnapshots` on mount and replaces it with a zero-volume box (`Vector3d.ZERO` min and max). The original box is restored on dismount, force-clear, and disconnect (for both rider-disconnects and carrier-disconnects).
- **Why:** the engine's `MountedComponent` is purely client-visual — the rider's server position stays exactly on the carrier. With the rider's full-size box still in place, the carrier's collision sweep was getting pushed >10 blocks per tick, which tripped `PlayerProcessMovementSystem`'s "Jump in location in processMovementBlockCollisions" guard, spammed warnings, and reset the carrier's velocity each tick.
- New `shrinkRiderBoundingBox` / `restoreRiderBoundingBox` helpers handle the snapshot/restore lifecycle.
- `forceClearByPlayer` now also restores the rider's box on disconnect for both directions (rider disconnecting and carrier disconnecting), with safe fallbacks when the player ref is no longer valid.

### `PiggybackFollowSystem` (`More Bug Fixes`)

- New per-tick [`PiggybackFollowSystem`](src/main/java/com/airijko/endlessleveling/endlessmarriage/systems/PiggybackFollowSystem.java) (~111 LOC) copies the carrier's `TransformComponent` position into the rider's transform every tick.
- **Why:** without this, the rider's server-side position never updates — the `MountedComponent` only renders the visual offset on the client. The rider's camera anchors to the server position, so it stayed glued to wherever they originally pressed the use key.
- Direct-assigns the position (bypassing `Player.moveTo` / `addLocationChange`) so no `collisionPositionOffset` accumulates on the rider — safe because the rider's box is now zero-volume.
- Per-store: only syncs sessions where both spouses are present in the currently-ticking store. Cross-world cases are left to the dismount / pre-teleport hooks.
- New `PiggybackService` accessors to support this: `getCarrierFor(rider)`, `getRiderFor(carrier)`, and `getRiderToCarrierView()` (a live read-only view of the `riders` map for tick walks).

### `MarriageProximitySystem` Rewrite (`Bug Fixes`)

- [`MarriageProximitySystem`](src/main/java/com/airijko/endlessleveling/endlessmarriage/systems/MarriageProximitySystem.java) is now fully per-store:
  - The single shared `timeSinceLastCheck` accumulator is replaced with a per-`Store` `ConcurrentHashMap` — previously, on a multi-world server, the system was called once per store per tick, so a single shared accumulator advanced N× faster than intended.
  - Spouse entity refs are looked up via `entityStore.getRefFromUUID()` instead of `Universe.getPlayer().getReference()`. This guarantees subsequent `store.getComponent(...)` reads happen on the correct store thread (the previous code was tripping `Store.assertThread()` and silently leaving couples flagged as "not near").
  - When only one of the two spouses is present in the ticking store, the present one gets cleared from `playersNearSpouse` and the absent one is left for whichever store actually owns them.
- New `onStoreShutdown(store)` hook drops the per-store throttle entry so the map doesn't hold dead `Store` references.

### `SpouseProtectionSystem` — Hard Cancel (`Bug Fixes`)

- [`SpouseProtectionSystem`](src/main/java/com/airijko/endlessleveling/endlessmarriage/systems/SpouseProtectionSystem.java) now takes a `MarriageDataManager` dependency in its constructor.
- Before applying the existing piggyback damage reduction, it inspects `damage.getSource()` for a `Damage.EntitySource` (which also covers projectiles via `ProjectileSource`). If the attacker is a player, is married, and the defender is their spouse, `damage.setAmount(0f)` cancels the hit outright.
- Wired up in [`EndlessMarriage.onEnable`](src/main/java/com/airijko/endlessleveling/endlessmarriage/EndlessMarriage.java) with the new `marriageDataManager` argument.

### Config Migration

- [`MarriageConfigMigrator.BUNDLED_CONFIG_VERSION`](src/main/java/com/airijko/endlessleveling/endlessmarriage/config/MarriageConfigMigrator.java) bumped `1` → `2`. Every existing user config file with a lower version will be merged forward against the bundled `config.json` on next boot.

### Command Rename (`renamed admin debug menu`)

- `/marry admin menu` → `/marry admin testmenu` ([`DebugMenuCommand`](src/main/java/com/airijko/endlessleveling/endlessmarriage/commands/subcommands/DebugMenuCommand.java)). The previous name collided with the real `/marry menu` slot reserved for the player-facing main page.
- [`DebugCommand`](src/main/java/com/airijko/endlessleveling/endlessmarriage/commands/subcommands/DebugCommand.java) help text updated to list `testmenu` instead of `menu`.

### Version

- `gradle.properties`: `2.1.0` → `2.1.1`.
- `config.json` `config_version` and `manifest.json` synced to match.

## 2026-04-08 — 2.1.0 (compared to 1.0.0)

This is the first major content update since the 1.0.0 launch. Endless Marriage went from a minimal "marry / divorce / ring" system to a full marriage feature suite with ceremonies, rings, kissing, piggyback, debug tooling, an admin UI, cooldowns, and a permission overhaul.
